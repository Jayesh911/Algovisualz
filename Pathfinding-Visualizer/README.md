Welcome to Pathfinding Visualizer! I built this application because I was fascinated by pathfinding algorithms, and I wanted to visualize them in action. I hope that you enjoy playing around with this visualization tool . You can access it here: https://jayesh911.github.io/Algovisualz/

Meet the Algorithms
This application supports the following algorithms:

Dijkstra's Algorithm : the father of pathfinding algorithms; guarantees the shortest path 
| Breath-first Search: a great algorithm; guarantees the shortest path 
| Dfs: not optimal because it explores one path deeply before considering alternatives
